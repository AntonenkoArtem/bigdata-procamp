# Persistent layer design

In this lab you will make flat star schema ER-diagram.

Use flight delays https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv to make initial analysis

## Exercise: Create diagram

Use tool of your preference (draw.io is recommended) to make a ER-diagram.
Follow the next rules:
1. Use every column in the dataset
2. Diagram has to have no complex/custom data types
3. Final design has to follow star schema principles

Send URL to your ER-diagram/or send a screenshot of the drawing to the big-data-program@globallogic.com address with the "HW1" text in the header
